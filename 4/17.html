─── BGGP5 Wrapped ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\\──

Wow! Another year, another BGGP. The theme this year was <a href="https://binary.golf/5">"Download"</a>. The goal 
was to download a file from the Binary Golf website (https://binary.golf/5/5) 
and display it in some way.

We got over 120 entries and 50 file formats! We had a number of new file 
formats, including Adobe ExtendScript, Erlang BEAM Bytecode, LaTeX, and 
LLVM-IR.

Let's get into what happened!

::: Approaches To The Challenge ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

This was our example entry:

    #!/bin/sh
    wget https://binary.golf/5/5
    cat 5

And expected output:

    $ ./bggp5.sh
    Another #BGGP5 download!! @binarygolf https://binary.golf

Downloading a file seems simple enough right? You do this every day, and it Just 
Works. When you think about it, there is actually a lot more work going on.

A classic <a href="https://github.com/alex/what-happens-when">interview question</a> is "What happens when you type google.com into your 
browser and press enter?". You can go infinitely into the weeds on this, from 
the prefrontal and parietal cortex planning the movement of your fingers, to 
the premotor and motor cortex sequencing and sending commands to move your 
fingers, to even more low level biological and atomic actions involved in your 
brain and the CPU you are interfacing with. For our purposes, we want to know 
what you need from a computer's perspective to download a file.

The basic steps are:

- Resolve the domain with a <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1035">DNS query</a>
- Create a <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9293">TCP Socket</a> using the system's socket APIs.
- Perform a <a href="https://tls13.xargs.org/">TLS Handshake</a> with the host
- Send an <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9110">HTTP GET Request</a>
- Read the response
- Display the contents

Depending on your target system and file format, some of these steps many be 
handled for you.

The file to download in this challenge was hosted on the Binary Golf website, 
which uses TLS and is served via Github. This was one of the more significant 
hurdles for BGGP5, as <a href="https://github.com/gh2o/bash_tls">code</a> that can negotiate TLS or other cryptographic APIs 
can add a non-trivial amount of bytes and complexity to a given entry.

Let's take a look at how golfers approached this and other aspects of the 
challenge!

::: Living Off The Land ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

While many programming languages and libraries offer APIs to download content 
from the internet, many golfers opted to use binaries or features that are 
usually already on a given target system.

<a href="https://curl.se">Curl</a> seemed to be the most popular choice for this, as it is common on Linux, 
MacOS, and even Windows, and has been compiled for <a href="https://curl.se/docs/features.html">101 operating systems and 
28 CPU architectures</a> and counting. Since it can handle all the TLS negotiation 
for you, and the default behavior is to display the content from the host, it 
was an obvious choice for many.

Others went with <a href="https://www.openssl.org">OpenSSL</a>, which can be used to establish TLS connections and 
allow users to send/receive HTTP requests and responses. An impressive example 
was neuschaefer's <a href="https://github.com/binarygolf/BGGP/blob/main/2024/entries/neuschaefer/neuschaefer.elf-ARMv5-J.txt">ELF</a> written in ARM Jazelle DBX, using OpenSSL to get the file.

bah's <a href="https://github.com/binarygolf/BGGP/blob/main/2024/entries/bah/bah.elf64.txt">entry</a> implemented a wild dynamic linking idea that patched /bin/bash in 
memory and overwrote main() with code to dlopen() libssl, then call it to 
download the file.

retr0id used <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/networking/tls.html">KTLS</a> and <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/crypto/userspace-if.html">Linux Kernel Crypto APIs</a> to make a <a href="https://github.com/binarygolf/BGGP/blob/main/2024/entries/retr0id/retr0id.elf64.txt">static aarch64 
userland curl</a> implementation that calls these APIs. While the file itself was 
3043 bytes, it demonstrated interesting use of cryptography in the kernel.

::: To Arg Or Not To Arg? ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

One of the key distinctions for this and other BGGP challenges was whether or 
not an entry uses command line arguments. Environment variables can also be used 
to hold data and code. For each file format, entries that used arguments or 
environment variables were scored separately from entries that were a standalone 
file. The URL for file to download was 23 bytes, so using arguments or env vars 
made sense to make an entry even smaller.

::: URL Shorteners :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

We didn't explicitly ban URL shorteners or small domain names because we didn't 
want to limit how small people could go, or limit people targeting systems and 
formats that predate SSL/TLS and required a proxy. Many people flexed their 5 or 
6 byte domain names.

::: File Name Hax ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Another approach that helped people save space this year was to use the filename 
as code.

continue won <a href="https://github.com/binarygolf/BGGP/blob/main/2024/entries/continue/continue.py.txt">python without args</a> (and <a href="https://github.com/binarygolf/BGGP/blob/main/2024/entries/continue/continue.pyc.txt">pyc</a>), by executing the entire filename as
a script.

<a href="https://github.com/binarygolf/BGGP/blob/main/2024/entries/mebeim/mebeim.php.txt">mebeim</a> and <a href="https://github.com/binarygolf/BGGP/blob/main/2024/entries/Digoguenes/Digoguenes.php.15.txt">Digoguenes</a> used the filesystem itself to store the URL with their PHP
entries, by creating directories that pointed to binary.golf/5/5

gremlinbeet's 3 byte <a href="https://github.com/binarygolf/BGGP/blob/main/2024/entries/gremlinbeet/gremlinbeet.bat.txt">batch file</a> entry ran a powershell script from the filename, 
which caused the system to reboot and display the contents from a text file on 
next boot.

Luna Hart's 2 byte <a href="https://github.com/binarygolf/BGGP/blob/main/2024/entries/Luna%20Hart/Luna%20Hart.sh.txt">shell script</a> stored the entire command in the filename, and 
executed with a simple $0.

jbo also did a 2 byte <a href="https://github.com/binarygolf/BGGP/blob/main/2024/entries/jbo/jbo.sh.txt">shell script</a> with arguments that executed $1.

::: 0 Bytes ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

In previous years, we have explicitly states that 0 byte files weren't allowed. 
This year, we forgot to put that in the challenge, and as a result, got some 
cool "0 byte" files that achieved the goal. In future BGGP challenges, we can 
make a one liner category to collect some of these cool tricks!

::: Wildest Entry ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

qkumba wins the award for "Wildest Entry" with his absolutely mad <a href="https://github.com/binarygolf/BGGP/blob/main/2024/entries/qkumba/qkumba.com.txt">COM</a> file 
written in 16 bit x86 assembly. The submission itself is a base64 string, 
with a base64 decoder in the code, that you can paste into notepad and 
execute. Golf claps for qkumba all around.

─── Looking Forward ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\\──

We made a few changes this year to our process to try to make things easier for 
both golfers and verifiers. This year we started using git issues on the BGGP 
repo to track entries, verification, and discussion around them. It also makes 
it easier for verifiers to track the status of an entry or any changes/updates 
to it.

Verifying the entries this year took a bit longer than expected for a variety of 
reasons. There will be a follow up blog to this about ways we plan to improve, 
and ways you can get involved and tell us what you would like to see in the 
future. Follow the Binary Golf Association on socials for more info!

We also have a new experimental tool to process BGGPx entry files. Feel free to 
play with it and help us improve! <a href="https://github.com/binarygolf/bggp-tools">https://github.com/binarygolf/bggp-tools</a>

BGGP is becoming a lot more well known, with entries being cited in papers, used 
for testing by organizations and companies, and increasing coverage in media 
outlets. The more accessible we can make our data set, the better.

─── Thank Yous ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\\──
